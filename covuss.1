.SH NAME
covuss \- CVSS parser and calculator

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "covus [-h|--help] [-d|--detail] ([-i|--interactive] |"
.I CVSS_VECTOR)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B covuss
is a CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) parser and calculator with two
main functions. When given CVSS vector as an argument on a command line,
.BR covuss " will calculate CVSS score for given vector."
Alternatively, you can enter interactive mode to create new CVSS by answering
bunch of questions. You will be given score and CVSS vector of your input at
the end.
.PP
Currently only CVSS v2 is supported.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-h, --help"
Show usage and exit
.IP "-d, --detail"
Apart from overall score, display also detailed scoring. Includes (if
applicable) impact score, exploitability score, base score, adjusted impact
score, adjusted base score, adjusted temporal score and environmental score.
Automatically enabled in interactive mode.

.IP "-i, --interactive"
Enter interactive mode. Enabled if no cvss vector has been given. Automatically
enables detailed output (-d).

In this mode, you have a vulnerability (e.g. CVE)
which you wish to evaluate with CVSS. You will be asked about value of each
CVSS metric for your specific vulnerability, starting with (mandatory) base
metrics group, followed by (optional) temporal and environmental metrics
groups.

When inquired, you either select one of offered values or invoke a help
for given metric/group by entering '?'. The help output is formatted and paged
so it would fit standard 80x25 screen. You may exit the interactive mode at any
time by entering 'q' or CTRL-C. For your convenience, you don't have to enter
the values upper case (all the input is uppercased and stripped of whitespace).

.IP "-p, --pretty"
Make the output colorful.

.TP
.I CVSS_VECTOR
CVSS vector you wish to get score of.
